# 🧮 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Programs

This repository contains foundational programs developed during my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course. These C programs cover basic data structures and algorithmic logic using stacks, queues, linked lists, recursion, and expression evaluation.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- `array_of_n_integers` – Basic array operations and manipulation
- `Cqqueue` – Circular queue implementation
- `evaluation_of_postfix` – Evaluate postfix expressions using stack
- `infix_to_postfix` – Convert infix expressions to postfix notation
- `menu_driven_queue` – Queue operations with a user-driven menu
- `singly_linked_list` – Implementation of a singly linked list with insertion and deletion
- `stack_of_integers` – Stack operations using array
- `student_structure` – Handling student records using structures
- `towersofhanoi` – Recursive solution to the classic Towers of Hanoi problem

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fragan7dsouza/dsa-programs.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder
3. Compile and run using GCC  
   ```bash
   gcc program.c -o output
   ./output
   ```
